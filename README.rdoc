== Shared Learning Collaborative integration in a Rails App
This is an example application that integrates with InBloom and shows 'an intervention with communication' application.

To set up a sandbox enviroment for SLC, follow this guide: http://dev.slcedu.org/getting-started/creating-sandbox-account

It uses some of the strategies in Ryan Bate's Railscast #241 Simple OmniAuth: http://railscasts.com/episodes/241-simple-omniauth.

=== Setup

To use this app you will need to export environment variables
   export INBLOOM_KEY=YOUR KEY
   export INBLOOM_SECRET=YOUR SECRET
   export TWILIO_SID=twilio-sid
   export TWILIO_TOKEN=twilio-token

   (optional)
   export TWILIO_PHONES=list of phone numbers if evaluation twilio account e.g. ['+11112223333']

 You may also store these as YML in a file called `.credentials.yml` (this file should not be shared or in git)


When you create an application as described in "registering your application" at http://dev.slcedu.org/getting-started/creating-sandbox-account

set your application location to:
  http://localhost:3000/
set your callback url to:
  http://localhost:3000/auth/slc/callback

Please check with InBloom.org for the latest api uri's.
